#Program name:  AI Dapp Tester
#Slogan: Automatically test a DAPP with the click of a button within seconds.

The application is designed to deploy a test version of a DAPP that can automatically detect any code it's given, and then put the code into the correct locations, files or folders to ensure that the DAPP is working correctly.
The user can input the code by providing it to the front end UI/UX, the application then saves the code, and once the user is done with providing the code, he will be able to click on the "Test" button, this will trigger the back-end code to run the program as a test on a local server.
The back-end code is using the file system to save and read the code, which could be changed to a database for better performance. The back-end code assumes that the DAPP is written in JavaScript and Solidity, you may have to customize the code to handle other languages.
The application also includes a simple UI/UX design that allows the user to input their code and test it, the design uses a black background with white text and red buttons, the front-end code uses JavaScript to handle the form submission and the test button clicks, which then communicate with the back-end code to save the code.
It's important to note that this is a skeleton code, it needs a lot of work and testing to make it functional.
